4. **Technical Requirements**:

   - Should be properly cached with appropriate headers

5. **Placement**:

   - Reference in HTML with absolute URL: `https://www.softworkstrading.com/images/og-hero-image.jpg`

## Implementation Notes

The OG image is critical for achieving high engagement rates on social media. When users share your content, this image will appear in their social feeds, making it a key brand asset.

To generate this image:
1. Use the existing brand assets as a base
2. Ensure text is readable at smaller sizes (when previewed in social media feeds)
3. Test the image with the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/), [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator), and [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)

After implementation, update the head tags to reference this new optimized image.
