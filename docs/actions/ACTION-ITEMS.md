## Tracking Progress

Use this document to track progress by checking off items as they are completed. Consider implementing the following workflow:

1. Start with Phase 1 items
2. Hold a review meeting after Phase 1 completion
3. Update priorities if needed before starting Phase 2
4. Document any additional items that come up during implementation

Each week, review progress and adjust priorities based on project needs and discoveries during implementation.
