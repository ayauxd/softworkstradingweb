# SEO Implementation Validation Report

## Overview
The SEO improvements to SoftworksTradingWeb have been successfully implemented and tested. The site now properly delivers content to crawlers and headless requests.

## Implementation Summary
1. **Static prerendering** added to build pipeline:
   - Created `render-static.js` to generate prerendered HTML
   - Integrated prerendering into `build.js`
   - Enhanced Express routing in `server/render-server.js`
   - Updated cache headers in `render.yaml`

2. **Fixed issue causes**:
   - Original issue: Client-side only rendering (CSR) with no server-rendered HTML
   - Solution: Static prerendering during build without changing frameworks
