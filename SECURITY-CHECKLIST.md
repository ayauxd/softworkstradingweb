# Security Checklist - Softworks Trading Web

This document outlines the security improvements made and provides a checklist for deployment.

## âœ… Completed Security Improvements

1. **Removed Hardcoded API Keys**
   - Removed OpenAI API key from demo.html
   - Updated .env file with new, secure API keys
   - Created proper server-side proxy for API requests

2. **Environment Variable Security**
   - Updated .env files with strong, randomly generated secrets
   - Enhanced .gitignore to properly exclude sensitive files
   - Created .env.example with proper placeholders

3. **Server-Side Security**
   - Created safe demo route that proxies API requests without exposing keys
   - Protected sensitive endpoints with CSRF tokens
   - Implemented proper validation of environment variables

4. **Client-Side Security**
   - Updated client code to use server-side proxies instead of direct API calls
   - Implemented fallbacks for when services are unavailable
   - Improved error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information

## ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

When deploying the application, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Add all API keys to your hosting provider's environment variables
   - [ ] Generate and set strong CSRF_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET values
   - [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
   - [ ] Configure CLIENT_URL to match your deployment URL

2. **Security Headers**
   - [ ] Verify that security headers are set correctly in production
   - [ ] Ensure CORS settings allow only trusted domains
   - [ ] Check that Content Security Policy is correctly configured

3. **API Keys & Secrets**
   - [ ] Verify that no API keys are included in client-side code
   - [ ] Ensure all API requests are proxied through the server
   - [ ] Confirm API keys have appropriate permission scopes

4. **Production Configuration**
   - [ ] Enable rate limiting for API endpoints
   - [ ] Configure session timeouts appropriately
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS and proper redirect from HTTP

## ðŸ”’ Key Protection Measures

The application implements the following security measures:

1. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Zod schema validation ensures all required variables are present and valid
   - Sensible defaults for development
   - Clear error messages for missing or invalid variables

2. **API Key Protection**
   - Server-side proxy approach for all third-party API interactions
   - Robust fallback mechanisms when services are unavailable
   - No API keys in client-side code or repositories

3. **CSRF Protection**
   - Double-submit cookie pattern for CSRF protection
   - Secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management
   - Token validation for all state-changing operations

4. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Sanitized error messages that don't leak sensitive information
   - Redacted logging that filters out sensitive values
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## ðŸ”„ Regular Security Tasks

1. **Key Rotation**
   - [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets regularly (at least every 90 days)
   - [ ] Update environment variables after rotation
   - [ ] Verify application works correctly after rotation

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - [ ] Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Run security scans against dependencies
   - [ ] Test application thoroughly after updates

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - [ ] Implement logging and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
   - [ ] Monitor API usage to detect unusual patterns
   - [ ] Review security posture regularly
