Design and develop the full frontend for the Softworks Trading Company landing page using React and Tailwind CSS inside Replit.

🧩 Technologies to Use:
- React (functional components, hooks)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router DOM (if needed for modals/interactions)
- Heroicons or Lucide for iconography

🧠 Design System & Brand:
- Font: Sans-serif (preferably Inter or system default)
- Colors:
  - Deep Navy: `#0A2A43` (backgrounds/primary text)
  - Bright Cyan: `#00BCD4` (buttons/accents)
  - Soft White: `#F9FAFC` (background)
  - Neutral Gray: `#4A5568` (secondary text)
- Favicon: Use the logo provided (attached PNG)
- Page should work in both light and dark mode (theme toggle included)

     - `Call`: Plays a 2-second voice call animation (use an animated mic or waveform SVG), then auto-pops a small form:
       - Fields: Name, Phone, What do you want help with?
       - Submit button: “Request a Callback”
