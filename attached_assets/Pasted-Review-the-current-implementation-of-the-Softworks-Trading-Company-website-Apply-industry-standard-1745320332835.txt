Review the current implementation of the Softworks Trading Company website.

Apply industry-standard UI/UX heuristics based on Nielsen’s principles and modern web design best practices, while preserving the existing layout structure and styling. Do not break page flow or remove any sections.

---

🔍 Apply the following heuristics and corrections:

### 1. **Visibility of System Status**
- Add visual feedback to all interactive elements (buttons, forms, toggles).
- Example: Use `hover`, `focus`, and `active` states on CTAs and chat prompts.

### 2. **Match Between System & Real-World Language**
- Simplify technical phrases for general users:
  - “Agentic Workflow” → “Smart Workflow Assistant” (where appropriate)
  - “Strategy Session” → “Planning Session” (unless intended as formal)

### 3. **Consistency & Standards**
- Use consistent spacing across all sections (e.g., padding between grids).
- Normalize heading styles (`text-2xl` for sections, `text-lg` for cards).
- Ensure light/dark mode text colors are properly inverted (`text-white`/`dark:text-white`).

### 4. **Recognition Over Recall**
- Use labels/icons on buttons where possible to reduce ambiguity.
  - Add label to voice CTA icon (e.g., `aria-label="Start voice chat"`)
  - Add `title` attribute on all external links (e.g., Learn More → “Learn more about automation”)

### 5. **Error Prevention**
- Validate form fields (email, name, message) with `required` attributes.
- Add fallback states for testimonials and articles (empty state or “loading” state).

### 6. **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**
- Audit all section paddings: ensure consistent top/bottom spacing (`py-16`, `py-24`).
- Balance section contrasts (e.g., use alternating `bg-slate-100` or `bg-white` with consistent padding).
- Ensure that no section is crowded or has awkward empty space.

### 7. **Responsive Layout Enhancements**
- Test each section at screen widths: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.
- Fix any overlapping grid elements or cutoff text at smaller breakpoints.

### 8. **Accessibility**
- Ensure all inputs and buttons have:
  - `aria-labels`
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Sufficient contrast ratios for text/backgrounds (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Confirm all images have meaningful `alt` text.

🛠️ Apply improvements **without breaking any of the following:**
- Section order and layout
- Voice/chat CTA functionality
- Testimonials slider
- Article card grid
- Footer layout and branding

Once applied, test responsiveness and visual consistency in both **light and dark mode**.
