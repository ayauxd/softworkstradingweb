Please implement the following enhancements to improve accessibility, responsiveness, and interaction quality:

---

### 1. Floating Chat/Call Icon (Persistent on Page)

**Functionality:**
- Add a floating action button (FAB) in the **bottom-right corner** of every page (`fixed bottom-5 right-5 z-50`).
- This FAB should allow users to reopen the "Talk to a Workflow Agent" modal at any time.
- The default state should show a ðŸ’¬ **chat icon**. After a user initiates a call, it may toggle to ðŸ“ž **call icon** for consistency.

**Design Standards:**
- Follow Material Design / iOS FAB standards:
  - `rounded-full`, `shadow-md`, `hover:scale-105`, subtle transition (`transition-all duration-200`)
  - Light Mode: `bg-white text-[#0A2A43]`
  - Dark Mode: `bg-gray-800 text-white`
- Mobile responsiveness:
  - Ensure icon size is tappable (at least `48x48px`)
  - Provide spacing (`mb-5`, `mr-5`) so it doesn't interfere with other mobile UI elements.

---

### 2. Modal Enhancements (Chat / Call)

**Behavior:**
- The modal opens when the FAB or hero CTA is clicked.
- When either **chat** or **call** is selected, show **only the selected interface** (donâ€™t display both toggles).
- Modal should auto-size based on content but **remain scrollable on small screens**.

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Use `max-w-screen-sm` for modal width.
- Ensure all text and buttons are touch-optimized (`text-base`, button height `min-h-[44px]`).
- Allow **swipe-to-close** or include a visible **close (X)** button in the top-right with `aria-label="Close"`.
- Animate modal opening/closing with subtle ease transitions.

---

### 3. Accessibility & UX

- All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.
- Add `aria-labels` for icons and close buttons.
- On mobile, prevent background scroll when modal is open.
- Consider visual feedback (highlight border or slight shake) if required fields in the call form are left empty on submit.
