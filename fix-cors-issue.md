# CORS Issue Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the CORS issue between the frontend at www.softworkstrading.com and the backend at softworks-trading.onrender.com.

## Issue Description

The production website at www.softworkstrading.com was unable to connect to the API server at softworks-trading.onrender.com due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. This resulted in the chat and voice features not working, despite having the correct API keys configured in the Render environment variables.

Error messages in the browser console indicated:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://softworks-trading.onrender.com/api/csrf-token' from origin 'https://www.softworkstrading.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added CORS Middleware**:
   - Created `/server/middleware/cors.ts` to properly configure CORS settings
   - Allowed specific origins including www.softworkstrading.com
   - Enabled credentials for authentication
   - Added preflight request handling

2. **Updated Server Configuration**:
   - Imported and applied CORS middleware in `/server/index.ts`
   - Ensured CORS middleware is applied before security and CSRF middleware
   - Enhanced CSP configuration to allow connections to the Render backend

3. **Enhanced Client-Side API URL Handling**:
   - Improved the `getApiBaseUrl()` function in `/client/src/lib/utils.ts`
   - Added better handling for different deployment scenarios

4. **Added Testing and Debugging Tools**:
   - Created `/check-api-connectivity.js` to test CORS and API connectivity
   - Added `npm run test:api-connectivity` command
   - Added health check and API key validation endpoints

5. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Enhanced `/docs/API-INTEGRATIONS.md` with CORS troubleshooting information
   - Added detailed explanation of how CORS works and how to diagnose issues

## How to Test the Fix

After deploying these changes to Render, you can verify the fix with these steps:

1. **Run API Connectivity Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:api-connectivity
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   Visit www.softworkstrading.com and open the browser developer tools. The CORS errors should no longer appear when using the chat or voice features.

3. **Test the Features**:
   Use the chat and voice features on the live site to verify they're working correctly.

## Next Steps

If issues persist after deploying these changes:

1. Check Render logs for any errors
2. Verify the environment variables are correctly set in Render
3. Confirm that the `CLIENT_URL` environment variable in Render is set to `https://www.softworkstrading.com`
4. Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode to rule out cached issues
5. Use the API connectivity test script with custom parameters to diagnose specific issues:
   ```bash
   API_URL=https://softworks-trading.onrender.com FRONTEND_DOMAIN=https://www.softworkstrading.com npm run test:api-connectivity
   ```
