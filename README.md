# ðŸ§¾ Softworks Trading Company â€“ Project Overview

## 1. Project Purpose  
A sophisticated React-based landing page for Softworks, delivering an AI workflow automation platform with advanced interaction design and user-centric modal experiences. The website serves SMEs and solo entrepreneurs exploring AI adoption, simplifying how users engage with AI automation through agentic workflows, consultations, and education.

## SEO Implementation

This site now implements static prerendering for search engine optimization:

1. **Static Prerendering Pipeline**
   - `render-static.js` generates complete HTML versions of key pages during build 
   - Enhanced Express server in `render-server.js` prioritizes prerendered files

2. **Benefits**
   - Complete HTML is served to crawlers even without JavaScript execution
   - All content is visible in social shares and search previews
   - Fast initial load times with Time-to-First-Byte < 500ms
   - No impact on client-side SPA behavior for regular users

3. **Validation**
   ```bash
   # Verify populated HTML is served without JS execution
   curl -Ls https://softworkstrading.com | grep -q "Automate Your Business With Practical AI Solutions" && echo "Success!" || echo "Failed"
   
   # Check performance
   curl -I https://softworkstrading.com
   ```

## 10. Design Philosophy

The website aims to provide a professional, clean interface that communicates the value of AI automation services without overwhelming visitors with technical jargon. Key design principles include:

- Clear and concise messaging
- Visual representations of complex concepts
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Multiple entry points for consultation
- Consistent branding and visual language

## 11. AI Service Configuration

The website integrates with multiple AI services to power the chatbot and voice call features:

### Environment Variables Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as a template)
2. Add your API keys for the following services:

```
# AI Service API Keys (required for full functionality)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=your_default_voice_id_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production  # Set to production for deployment
HOST=0.0.0.0
API_TIMEOUT=30000

# Security Configuration
CSRF_SECRET=generate_a_random_string_here
SESSION_SECRET=replace_with_at_least_32_characters_long_secret_key

# Client URL (used for CORS in production)
CLIENT_URL=https://your-render-deployment-url.onrender.com
```

### Fallback System

The system is designed with fallbacks to ensure reliability:

1. **Chat Services**:
   - Primary: OpenAI (GPT-3.5 Turbo)
   - If it fails: Returns a graceful error message
   - Note: Gemini integration is provided but disabled in current implementation

2. **Voice Services**:
   - Primary: OpenAI TTS
   - If it fails: Chat continues without voice
   - Note: ElevenLabs integration is provided but disabled in current implementation

### Configuring Voice Options

- For OpenAI TTS, edit `voiceIntegration.ts` to change the voice (default is 'nova')
- Available OpenAI voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
- Each voice has a different character and tone, with 'nova' being warm and natural

### Testing Without API Keys

The system will continue to function without API keys by providing mock responses for development. In production, ensure all keys are properly configured.

### Deployment to Render

To deploy the application to Render:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create a new Web Service in Render dashboard
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the environment variables in the Render dashboard:
   - Add all the variables from your `.env` file
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Set `CLIENT_URL` to your Render deployment URL
5. Set the Build Command to `npm install && npm run build`
6. Set the Start Command to `npm start`

The system includes client-side fallbacks for both chat and voice features, so even if the API keys are not configured, the demo will still work with mock responses. However, for the best experience, configure all API keys in your production environment.

## 12. MCP Integration

This project includes Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for enhanced AI-powered development workflows. MCP allows Claude to interact with external tools and services through standardized APIs.

### MCP Servers

The following MCP servers are configured:

1. **Core Development**
   - `typescript`: Execute TypeScript code directly
   - `node`: Run JavaScript files and Node.js scripts
   - `puppeteer`: Automate browser testing
   - `desktop-commander`: Manage files and project structure

2. **Frontend Development**
   - `react-tools`: Analyze and optimize React components

3. **AI Integration**
   - `openai`: Access OpenAI APIs for text generation and more
   - `elevenlabs`: Voice generation capabilities
   - `gemini`: Access Google Gemini for multimodal AI features

### Using MCP

To work with MCP servers:

1. **Setup MCP Servers**
   ```bash
   npm run setup-mcp
   ```

2. **Start Claude with MCP**
   ```bash
   # Use all MCP servers
   claude --with all
   
   # Use specific servers
   claude --with typescript,puppeteer
   ```

3. **MCP Development Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Development with MCP
   npm run mcp-dev
   
   # Testing with MCP
   npm run mcp-test
   ```

For detailed documentation on MCP usage, see `docs/AI-MCP-INTEGRATION.md`.

## 13. Deterministic Scaffolding

This project includes a deterministic scaffolding framework that can generate new projects with MCP integration. The scaffolding system is designed to be reproducible and extensible.

### Scaffolding with MCP

The scaffolding process includes:

1. **Core Files Generation**
   - Creates essential project files including `.mcp.json`
   - Configures MCP servers based on project type
   - Sets up MCP installation scripts

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Generates `.mcp.json` with appropriate servers
   - Creates setup scripts for MCP servers
   - Adds MCP usage examples for development

3. **Documentation**
   - Generates comprehensive MCP documentation
   - Includes example usage for each MCP server
   - Provides troubleshooting guidance

For instructions on using the scaffolding system, see the prompt at `scripts/deterministic-scaffolding-prompt.md`.

### Running the Scaffolder

To use the scaffolding system with Claude:

```bash
claude-code validate-metadata --file project.json
claude-code configure-mcp --file .mcp.json --servers typescript,puppeteer,desktop-commander,node
claude-code scaffold --meta project.json --with-mcp
```
