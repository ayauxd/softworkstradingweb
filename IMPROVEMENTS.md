   - Implemented WebP image format for all key images
   - Added responsive image sizes for optimal performance

2. **Documentation**
   - Added server architecture documentation
   - Created testing strategy documentation
   - Added placeholder tests for future implementation
   - Updated CLEANUP.md with completed tasks

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created test directory structure
   - Added Vitest configuration
   - Created example test files

4. **Content Improvements**
   - Improved hero section copy for better user engagement
   - Removed irrelevant blog articles to focus content
   - Simplified testimonials section for better performance

5. **DevOps Enhancements**
   - Fixed deployment issues on Render
   - Improved server error handling and logging
   - Added proper ESM support for server-side code

## Recommended Future Improvements

### 1. Server Architecture

Implement the recommended server structure:

```
/server
  ├── controllers/          # Request handlers
  ├── middleware/           # Express middleware
  ├── routes/               # API routes
  ├── services/             # Business logic
  ├── utils/                # Utility functions
  ├── config.ts             # Configuration
  └── index.ts              # Entry point
```

### 2. Security Enhancements

1. **Content Security Policy**
   - Remove `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` where possible
   - Add missing directives (worker-src, manifest-src)
   - Use more restrictive object-src policy

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper auth flow with JWT or sessions
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting

### 3. Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert JPEG/PNG to WebP format
   - Implement responsive images with srcset
   - Add explicit width/height to prevent layout shifts

2. **Code Optimization**
   - Implement React.memo for pure components
   - Use useCallback/useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### 4. Build Process

1. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Add rollup-plugin-visualizer
   - Implement bundle size monitoring

2. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Implement automated testing
   - Add deployment pipeline

### 5. Testing Implementation

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for React components
   - Test custom hooks
   - Test utility functions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test user flows
   - Test API integration

3. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Implement axe-core testing
   - Verify WCAG AA compliance

## Getting Started with Improvements

To begin implementing these improvements:

1. Start with the server structure refactoring
2. Add security enhancements
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Add CI/CD pipeline

These improvements will make the codebase more maintainable, secure, and efficient.
